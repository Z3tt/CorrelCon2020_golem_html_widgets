# CorrelCon Advanced Session

### Building a modularized Shiny app with the golem ðŸ“¦ and html widgets

* *Session:* Data Visualization  
* *Date:* November 7th 2020, 2:30PM (UTC+1)  
* *Speaker:* CÃ©dric Scherer (Data Visualization Designer & Computational Ecologist)

In this talk, I introduce you to modularized Shiny apps and a library called {golem} that simplifies the process of developing roduction-grade applications. I will also give an overview of html widgets that are useful for designing your app and allow for interactive charts and an overall nice user experience. I am going to demonstrate the possibilities using our Shiny app from the LC Berlin that recently won the CorrelAidX challenge.
